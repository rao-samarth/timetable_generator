# Timetable Generator

This is a modified version of https://github.com/pranshuul/timetable_generator
I have edited it to allow a friend group to create a timetable together, ie adding the feature of adding a "Name" to each course.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository by running `git clone git@github.com:samarth1rao/timetable_generator`
2. In a virtual environment, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `uv run main.py`
4. Open the application at http://localhost:8080
